        <h2>E-health records</h2>
        
        <p>The advent of digital technology has greatly enhanced patient medical records. 
            Patient and provider satisfaction has greatly improved due to electronic health records (EHR). The advent of digital records allows hospitals to take on new emergency patients already having their medical information, meaning they can safely avoid problems with possible allergies to certain medication that they wouldn't otherwise know.</p>
        
        <h3>Diagnostics</h3>
        <p>More recently, through the use of machine learning and deep learning technology, programs have been trained on vast swathes of medical imaging data and are now able to diagnose or identify possible diseases, such as tumors, that doctors might miss. A study showed that deep learning algorithms were able to detect pneumonia from chest radiography with greater accuracy than radiologists.</p>
