        <li style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">History</li>
        <p>Unreal Engine 5 was revealed on May 13, 2020, supporting all existing systems that could run Unreal Engine 4, including the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.It was released in early access on May 26, 2021, and formally launched for developers on April 5, 2022.</p>
        <li style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Features</li>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Nanite</b></li>
                <p style="line-height: 40px;">A major feature of Unreal Engine 5 is Nanite, a virtualized geometry system that allows developers to use photogrammetry and other high-detail meshes in their games without significant performance impact.Traditionally, artists had to create multiple models for different levels of detail (LoDs) and generate normal maps for finer details. Nanite automatically manages LoDs by scaling models dynamically based on draw distance, screen resolution, and performance requirements.It utilizes a hierarchical structure, allowing different parts of a single mesh to render at varying levels of detail. Nanite is compatible with many 3D model formats, including ZBrush sculpts and CAD models, enabling developers to directly import film-quality assets without manual optimization.</p>
            <li><b>Lumen</b></li>
                <p style="line-height: 40px;">Lumen is a fully dynamic ray traced global illumination and reflections system that can react in real-time to scene and lighting changes. It eliminates the need for precomputed lightmaps for a given scene and enables automatic adjustments to light, reflections, and shadows.Lumen supports both software and hardware ray tracing. The software ray tracing option, which uses Mesh Distance Fields, is optimized for a broad range of devices and enables fast ray intersections at the cost of lower fidelity.</p>
            <li><b>Other features</b></li>
                <p style="line-height: 40px;">Virtual Shadow Maps is another component added in Unreal Engine 5 described as "a new shadow mapping method used to deliver consistent, high-resolution shadowing that works with film-quality assets and large, dynamically lit open worlds". Virtual Shadow Maps differs from the common shadow map implementation in its extremely high resolution, more detailed shadows, and the absence of shadow cascade and pop-in issues present in commonly used shadow mapping techniques.</p>
